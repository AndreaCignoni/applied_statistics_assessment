# Statistical Analysis Project

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on different aspects of statistical analysis and Python programming. The first notebook involves a series of tasks related to basic statistical methods, while the second notebook is dedicated to a separate project that applies more advanced statistical techniques.

## Notebooks Overview

1. **Tasks**
This Jupyter notebook includes four tasks that cover essential statistical methods using Python and relevant libraries. These tasks are designed to help you understand and apply techniques such as permutations, combinations, distributions, and hypothesis testing.

**Task 1: Permutations and Combinations**
**Task 2: numpy's Normal Distribution**
**Task 3: t-Test Calculation**
**Task 4: ANOVA**

2. **Project: Analysis of PlantGrowth Dataset**
In this project, we will analyze the PlantGrowth dataset from R, which is available through the R datasets package. The dataset consists of two main variables:

*Treatment Group*: The type of treatment applied to the plants (categorical).
*Weight of Plants*: The measured weight of the plants in each treatment group (numerical).
Our objective is to explore the relationships between the treatment groups and plant weight by performing two key statistical tests:

*t-Tests*: To compare the means of two groups (treatment vs. control, or among specific pairs of treatment groups).
ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): To analyze whether there are statistically significant differences in plant weight across more than two treatment groups.

## How to Run the Notebooks
