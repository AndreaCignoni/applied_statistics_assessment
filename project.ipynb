    "The Plant Growth dataset, originally presented in Dobson, A. J. (1983) *An Introduction to Statistical Modelling* (London: Chapman and Hall), consists of dried plant weight measurements divided into three groups, each with 10 observations. The first group, labeled ctrl (control), represents the yield of plants grown under normal conditions and serves as the baseline or “before” sample. The second and third groups, labeled trt1 and trt2 (treatment 1 and treatment 2), represent the yields of plants subjected to two distinct treatments, which can be considered “after” samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset provides a foundation for evaluating the impact of experimental treatments on plant growth. By comparing the dried weights among these groups, it is possible to assess the relative effectiveness of the treatments using statistical methods such as t-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA). As a teaching example, the dataset illustrates concepts in experimental design and hypothesis testing, making it a valuable tool in statistical education and research."

    "As a first step in analyzing the results of the treatments represented by the 'after' samples, we will compare their means with the corresponding 'before' baseline. The t-test is particularly appropriate for assessing whether the differences observed are statistically significant or merely due to chance. Since our aim is to evaluate specific pairwise comparisons, the t-test provides a focused analysis that complements broader methods like ANOVA. Before conducting the t-test, we verify the assumptions of normality and independence of the paired samples to ensure the validity of the results."
