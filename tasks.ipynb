    "By conducting this experiment, we intend to prove whether the person’s ability to identify the preparation method of the tea cups is beyond random chance. If the person can consistently and accurately identify all six milk-first cups, the evidence would support the claim that they possess a special sensory ability. Conversely, if their success rate aligns with what would be expected by random guessing, the claim would lack statistical support.\n",
